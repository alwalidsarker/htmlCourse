if we type "www.walid.com" than this domain goes to or asks the server computers 
whether they have this domain or not if they able to find this then they serve its files to your 
device this is how website works

HTML => Hyper Text Markup Langauage
HyperText => is a text which contains a link or connection between other website pages or texts
( example : <a> walid </a> )

Markup Lang => it's a way to give instrucutions to the computers about how the things will be 
organized or displayed 
( example : <p> wlaid is a <strong> Boy </strong></p> ) 'here "strong" is an example'

<h1> => opening tag
</h1> => closing tag
between them is called content 
and full is called 'html element'

a <h1> is a must for a web page means it's a limitation 'interview question' ( we have to use this one time in a web page )
have to follow the hierarchy h1 to h6
